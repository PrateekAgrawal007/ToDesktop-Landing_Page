ToDesktop Landing Page Replica

Designed and developed a clone of the ToDesktop landing page, focusing on replicating its UI/UX while incorporating modern web design techniques. The project features:

UI/UX Design: Crafted a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, reflecting the design and functionality of the original ToDesktop page.

Responsive Layout: Ensured the page is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on various devices and screen sizes.

Interactive Elements:
Gradient Colors: Implemented gradient color effects to enhance visual appeal and create a dynamic look.
Scrolling Animation: Integrated horizontal scroll-based animations using IntersectionObserver, adding a parallax effect as users scroll.
Toggle Effect: Added a toggle effect for a navigation dialog, allowing users to show or hide the menu with a smooth transition.
Accordion Feature: Developed an accordion functionality that expands and collapses content sections with a rotating icon to indicate the state.

Tailwind CSS: Utilized Tailwind CSS for efficient styling, leveraging its utility-first approach to create a modern, responsive design.
Front-End Technologies: Employed HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS to build and style the landing page, focusing on both aesthetics and functionality.

This project enhanced my skills in UI/UX design and front-end development, demonstrating my ability to create engaging and polished web pages using advanced techniques and frameworks.
